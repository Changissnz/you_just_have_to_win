# You Just Have To Win
## Written by: Richard Pham 

You know the feeling, the experience of what is about to be written. You just 
had to win. You just had to win because you are right, the rightest person in 
the room. You just had to win and to do that, you just had to send the message 
of these things you fight for. You wanted your name to be spoken round the world, 
from the vassal familial lines of the Mongols to the sons of Thrace and even by 
the islander Japaneso-Sans, through word of mouth by the commercial mercenary 
Shen-Lin Tau Feng Hui Liang Chau Sak clan of China, the "center of the East", per 
se. You knew you had a responsibility to win. Your forefathers built entire empires 
out of pro-rated Japanese computers. And now at this stage in global production 
capacities, you feel you have no more use for the equipment your forefathers used, 
but the need for continuing legacy remains with you, without you, you thought to 
yourself. So you went over to South Korea and China, and now they are the ones making 
your computers to continue your empire, and this really is your empire, all of 
it, by the way. All of it. You see market trajectories are not looking good, and 
without feeling no guilt at all after dumping Japan as a business partner for 
South Korea and China, you are slowly dumping South Korea and China for India 
and Vietnam. The world is your home, and your home is your kingdom. You are 
ordained to do such great things, and you reaffirm these views of yours by 
ruling and running things with an iron fist even when controversy grows and hubbub 
sours. That is how order is established to ensue, you were taught by your forefathers. 
And those teachings forged your mentality to be the one you are today. You tactically 
think, "who needs Japan when I can go to China and South Korea, and who needs China 
and South Korea when I can go to India and Vietnam". You end this thinking with the 
poetic line, "the world is my home, and this is my vision". Well done, the world 
responds back, well done. You have won. You first send a strong message and then you 
delivered on that strong message to win, conclusively no less. What is next now with 
your empire?
